/*******************************************************************************
 *The application uses default settings for all configurable parameters.       *
 *Default values for all configurable parameters are placed in files *_cfg.h   *
 *for example domx_cfg.h, memtbl_cfg.h, omxcore_cfg.h                          *
 *If the setting is to be changed from default value this file has to define   *
